# Sample React Project
This example shows a simple sign up and log in page. The application uses the [Next.JS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) and [React-Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) Libraries in React to make this possible.



## How to use

To install the needed libraries:
```bash npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

```bash npm install react-bootstrap

```bash npm install styled-components


To run the application:
```bash npm run dev


You can view the project from localhost:3000
