# Sample React Project
This example shows a simple sign up and log in page. The application uses the [Next.JS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) and [React-Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) Libraries in React to make this possible.



## How to use

To install the needed libraries:

```npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest```

```npm install react-bootstrap```

```npm install styled-components```


To run the application:

```npm run dev```


You can view the project from localhost:3000
